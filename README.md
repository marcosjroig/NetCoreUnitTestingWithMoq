# . Net Core Unit Testing With Moq
This is a repository where I did a prototype to for unit testing using .Net Core, XUnit Test and Moq with C#

There are two projects: one is the "CreditCardApplication" project which has the code to test and the the testing project "CreditCardApplication.Tests"

This solution, which has a very simple code, nothing special using SOLID principles or a great code to look at, but most important is I tried to use the different features of Moq.
