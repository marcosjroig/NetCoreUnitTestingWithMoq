# . Net Core Unit Testing With Moq
I did a prototype to for unit testing using .Net Core, XUnit Test Project and Moq with C#

There are two projects: one is the "CreditCardApplication" project which has the code to test and the the testing project "CreditCardApplication.Tests"

This solution, which has a very simple code, nothing special using SOLID principles or a great code to look at, but most important is I tried to use the different features of Moq.

## Usage
I used for this project:
- Visual Studio 2017
- .Net Core 2.2
- XUnit test project for .Net Core
- C# and
- Moq
